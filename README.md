This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Originally started by the hamburger/dropdown mobile menu functionality not working on the main current website being fixed. There would be nice room to "modernize" and add QoL improvements from a UX perspective. 

## Getting Started

First, run the needed commands to install and then run dev

```bash
1. install dependenciies

npm install

(If it glitches out, this for some reason works, delete the nextjs folder, re-build it, then install)


npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## Assets - 
Please do borrow assets from each design, its encouraged. I recommend starting out with the top navbar with the my-tech design. I will leave that as the root foldeer

PLEASE DO DOCKERIZE OR ELSE YOUR PR WILL NOT BE MERGED
----
## Plans:
- Add github actions for push/pull and issues
- Isolate each design in its own folder
- Demonstrate later on, Deno(?)
- Open this up to othher people wanting to help out with design
